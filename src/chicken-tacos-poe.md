> Once upon a dreary eve, when shadows cast their sable cloak,
> I sought to conjure sustenance, from a lonesome chicken's yoke.
> In my chamber dimly lit, I gathered ingredients with care,
> To craft a meal of dire delight, a feast to ease my wearied stare.
> 
> First, the chicken's breast, so pale, I summoned from its icy tomb,
> A thawing process, slow and grim, as death's hand releases from the gloom.
> With knife in hand, I sliced it thin, a sacrifice to the culinary arts,
> While visions of a taco's form danced like spectral wraiths in my heart.
> 
> A skillet, wrought in iron dark, I placed upon the stove's cold hearth,
> With a somber flame, I set it aflame, to kindle life in its barren earth.
> In melted butter's mournful tears, the chicken pieces met their doom,
> They sizzled, sang, and danced in pain, their fragrance filling the room.
> 
> Then spices rare, from far-off lands, I sought to mend my tasteless meat,
> A pinch of cumin, salt, and pepper, to make this dish complete.
> With garlic crushed, its essence dark, I stirred it into the fray,
> As if it were the whispered chant, to keep the horrors at bay.
> 
> In a pan, I toasted tortillas, each one a charred and smoky shell,
> As I pondered life's uncertainties, in the warmth they'd soon impel.
> Once chicken's flesh was touched by fire, I laid it gently on the plate,
> With shredded cheese, fresh greens, and salsa, to seal the dish's fate.
> 
> As I gazed upon the chicken tacos, their aroma filling the chamber's air,
> I knew that in their savory depths, a taste of heaven I'd ensnare.
> With a tremulous hand, I devoured them all, in a ravenous, mournful spree,
> For even in life's darkest moments, a chicken taco's comfort set me free.
> 
> And so, dear reader, heed my tale, of chicken tacos, dark and grand,
> A culinary journey, forged with care, by my ever-questing hand.
> Though life may often vex and vex, and cast you in despair,
> Take solace in the simple joy, of a taco's tender, loving care.
